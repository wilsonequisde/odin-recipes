    <h1>Taco Stuffed Poblano Peppers</h1>
    <img src="../taco.jpg">
    <p>Poblano peppers are stuffed with ground meat and Spanish rice and baked in a tomato-based sauce with a sprinkling of cheese. American comfort food done up Latin-American style. We used boxed Spanish rice, but there are a number of good recipes on this site (Spanish Rice II and Best Spanish Rice) that I have used with good results. Serve with garnishments of choice - shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 large poblano peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded</li>
        <li>1 (6.8 ounce) package Spanish-style rice mix</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Â½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 2 cups water and butter to a boil in a saucepan; add rice and seasoning packet. Return to a boil, cover saucepan, reduce heat to low, and simmer until most water is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Fluff rice using a fork.</li>
        <li>Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil; cook poblano peppers until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer peppers to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process; drain. Pat peppers dry and place in the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Season beef with black pepper. Mix 1/2 cup water, chili powder, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper into ground beef; cook and stir until liquid evaporates, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix rice into beef mixture; cook and stir until evenly mixed and all liquid is evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes. Spoon mixture into the peppers.</li>
        <li>Stir tomato soup and about 1 tablespoon water together in a bowl until soup is thinned to a gravy consistency, adding more water if needed. Pour tomato gravy over stuffed peppers; top with mozzarella cheese. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue baking until cheese is slightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes more.</li>
